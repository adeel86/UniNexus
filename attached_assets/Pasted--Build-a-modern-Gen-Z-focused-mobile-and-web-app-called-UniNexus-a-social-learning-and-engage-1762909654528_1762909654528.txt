Build a modern, Gen Z–focused mobile and web app called UniNexus — a social, learning, and engagement platform for students, teachers, universities, industries, and master admins.
If any of the following features are missing from the current app, plan and implement them. Ensure that the sign-up and login flow uses Firebase Authentication with role selection. Populate all mock pages with realistic dummy data for demonstration.

Core Features
	1	Multi-role Authentication System
	◦	Roles: Student, Teacher, University, Industry, and Master Admin.
	◦	Each role should access a customised interface and dashboard.
	2	Student Social Feed
	◦	Posts (text and images), comments, and reactions.
	◦	Interest-based filtering to personalise the feed.
	3	Gamified Student Profiles
	◦	Show badges, skill tags, engagement scores, and an achievement timeline.
	4	AI-Powered Capabilities
	◦	Suggest posts based on interests and trending topics.
	◦	Include an AI career guidance chatbot.
	◦	Apply AI-based moderation for safe and inclusive content.
	5	Teacher Dashboard
	◦	View students, endorse skills, and analyse engagement insights.
	6	University Admin Panel
	◦	Display engagement metrics, retention rates, and allow announcements.
	7	Course Discussion Forums
	◦	Threaded Q&A with peer interactions and upvotes.
	8	Leaderboard System
	◦	Rank students based on engagement, problem-solving, and skill endorsements.
	9	Real-Time Notifications
	◦	Trigger for comments, reactions, endorsements, and badge unlocks.
	10	Vibrant Gen Z Interface
	◦	Neon gradient theme (purple–blue–pink).
	◦	Smooth animations, modern cards, and energetic visual style.
	◦	Optimised for mobile experience and quick interactions.

App Behaviour & Experience
	•	Provide mock data for all dashboards, profiles, posts, and analytics to create an engaging demo experience.
	•	Each role’s interface should reflect its goals — students focus on collaboration, teachers on mentorship, universities on oversight, and industry partners on innovation and opportunities.
	•	AI elements should enhance creativity, learning, and community growth rather than replace human interaction.
	•	Maintain a positive, safe, and motivating tone across the platform — professional but youthful.
	•	Ensure inclusivity and accessibility are reflected throughout design and content.

End Goal: Deliver a cohesive, fully populated app concept that demonstrates all listed features in an interactive, visually striking prototype suitable for Gen Z learners and educators.
