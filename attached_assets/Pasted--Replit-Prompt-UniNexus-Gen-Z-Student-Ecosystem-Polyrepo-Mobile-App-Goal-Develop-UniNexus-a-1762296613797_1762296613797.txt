🚀 Replit Prompt: UniNexus – Gen Z Student Ecosystem (Polyrepo Mobile App)
Goal:
Develop UniNexus, a mobile-first, AI-powered student ecosystem connecting learners, teachers, universities, and industry partners — integrating social networking, employability, gamified learning, and career development in a safe, vibrant, and engaging digital environment.
🧱 System Architecture: Polyrepo Setup
Use a polyrepo structure with distinct repositories for modular development and deployment flexibility.
Repositories:
uninexus-frontend → Mobile-first app (React Native + Expo / Next.js PWA)
uninexus-backend → Core API (Node.js + NestJS or Fastify)
uninexus-ai-services → AI microservices (Python/FastAPI)
uninexus-auth-service → Central authentication and authorisation (Supabase / Firebase)
uninexus-db-schema → Database schema + migrations (PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM)
uninexus-devops → CI/CD pipelines, Docker setup, deployment configs
uninexus-admin-panel → Central web admin interface (Next.js + Tailwind + Shadcn UI)
Each repo should be separately deployable and version-controlled, enabling independent scaling, updates, and service testing.
