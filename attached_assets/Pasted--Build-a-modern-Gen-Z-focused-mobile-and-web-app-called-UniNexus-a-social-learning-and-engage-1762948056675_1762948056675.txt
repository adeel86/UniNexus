Build a modern, Gen Z–focused mobile and web app called UniNexus — a social, learning, and engagement platform for students, teachers, universities, industries, and master admins.
If any of the following features are missing from the current app, plan and implement them. Ensure that the sign-up and login flow uses Firebase Authentication with role selection. Populate all mock pages with realistic dummy data for demonstration.

	◦	Roles: Student, Teacher, University, Industry, and Master Admin.

App Behaviour & Experience
	•	Provide mock data for all dashboards, profiles, posts, and analytics to create an engaging demo experience.
	•	Each role’s interface should reflect its goals — students focus on collaboration, teachers on mentorship, universities on oversight, and industry partners on innovation and opportunities.
	•	AI elements should enhance creativity, learning, and community growth rather than replace human interaction.
	•	Maintain a positive, safe, and motivating tone across the platform — professional but youthful.
	•	Ensure inclusivity and accessibility are reflected throughout design and content.

End Goal: Deliver a cohesive, fully populated app concept that demonstrates all listed features in an interactive, visually striking prototype suitable for Gen Z learners and educators.
